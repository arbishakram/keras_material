    "With Colab you can import any dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, using just a few lines of code. Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, by leveraging the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. \n"
